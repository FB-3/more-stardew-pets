## Contents

### Pets

You can add or remove pets to keep you company while coding.  
**Current pets:** cats, dogs, dinos, turtles, raccoons, ducks, goats, sheeps, ostrichs, pigs, rabbits, chicken, cows and junimos!

### Enemies

Enemies will sometimes appear in your farm.  
Clicking on one of them kills it and gives you money to buy decoration.  
**Current enemies:** bugs, crabs, golems and slimes!

### Decoration

You can use the money obtained by enemies to buy new decoration in the **General Store**.  
Aditionally, you can rearange or sell your current decoration by entering **Decor Mode**.

## Contributing

For the people who want to contribute, please ask if your change would be accepted before making it.  
I mainly take bug fixes, but you can ask for new features too.  
Just keep in mind I won't add things that aren't in ***Stardew Valley***, like recolours or new original pets.
