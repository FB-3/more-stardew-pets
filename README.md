## Pets

You can have pets with custom names to keep you company while coding.  

<details>
    <summary style="cursor: pointer">
        <b>Current pets:</b>
    </summary>
    <ul>
        <li>Cats</li>
        <li>Dogs</li>
        <li>Dinos</li>
        <li>Turtles</li>
        <li>Raccoons</li>

        <li>Junimos!</li>
    </ul>
</details>

## Monsters

Monsters will sometimes appear in your farm, with a maximum of 1 at a time.  
Clicking on one of them kills it and gives you money to buy decoration.  
You can disable monsters in settings if you don't want them to appear.  

<details>
    <summary style="cursor: pointer">
        <b>Current monsters:</b>
    </summary>
    <ul>
        <li>Bugs</li>
        <li>Crabs</li>
        <li>Golems</li>
        <li>Slimes</li>
    </ul>
</details>
  
## Decoration

You can use the money obtained by monsters to buy new decoration in the **General Store**.  
Aditionally, you can rearange or sell your current decoration by entering **Decor Mode**.  

<details>
    <summary style="cursor: pointer">
        <b>Current decoration:</b>
    </summary>
    <ul>
        <li>Chairs</li>
        <li>Stools</li>
        <li>Benches</li>
        <li>Tables</li>
        <li>Tea Tables</li>
        <li>End Tables</li>
        <li>Coffe Tables</li>
        <li>Rugs</li>
        <li>Cushions</li>
        <li>House Plants</li>
    </ul>

## Contributing

If you find bugs or have new features you want to see added, feel free to tell me via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/BOTPanzer/Stardew-Pets/issues).  

It's my personal project so I'd like to keep the code mine, but I also like listening to what the community wants.  
Just keep in mind I won't add things that aren't in **Stardew Valley**, like recolours or new original pets.  
If you want those, feel free to fork the repo and add me in the credits.
